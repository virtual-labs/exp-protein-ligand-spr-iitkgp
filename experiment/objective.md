## Objective

Surface plasmon resonance helps perform molecular interactions in real time. The studies can be used to observe if two or more interactants bind to each other. It can also be used to measure how strong the interactions are, and even to measure the actual association and dissociation rates, specificity, and affinity of the interactions.
The objectives of this experiment are:
1. To perform protein-protein interaction using surface plasmon resonance.
2. To analyze the molecular interaction obtained as an SPR curve or a sensorgram.
3. To calculate the binding affinity of the protein interactions performed.
